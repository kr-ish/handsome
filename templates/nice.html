<h1>Nice November</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Why not?
</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>
<ul><li>Perform one act of kindness each day.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
It may be offered to a stranger, to an acquaintance, to a loved one, or to yourself.
Vary the gesture: one day outward, another day inward. The chance to be kind will find you daily â€”
your task is only to remain open to it.
</p>
<p>
As always, follow your heart.
</p>

<h2>Possibilities</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Buy flowers from a local florist and give them to someone.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If you are in New York City- I really like Verdure Florist in Bedstuy, Stolen Magnolia in
            Bushwick/Ridgewood, and Sunny's Florist in the East Village.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Recall someone in your life of whom you are deeply proud, and tell them so.</li>
    <li>Cook for someone.</li>
    <li>Write someone a card.</li>
    <li>Forgive someone.</li>
    <li>And <a href="https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas">many more</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Remember- someone can be you. Just do something nice!</p>

    If you would like to participate, email me a statement. A picture of you would be nice too.
    The only hard requirements are your statement, and letting me know if you would like it added to the
    website.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the month, I will check in with each participant and request a reflection.
