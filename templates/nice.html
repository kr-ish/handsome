<h1>Nice November</h1>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Why not?
</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>
Perform one act of kindness every day. This could be for a stranger, an acquaintance, a loved one, or for yourself.
Switch it up- sometimes a stranger, sometimes yourself, etc.. The opportunity to be nice will present itself
to you everyday and all you have to do it be open to it.
</p>

<p>
Some ideas:
<ul>
    <li>Buy flowers from a local florist and give them to someone.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>If you're in New York- I really like Verdure Florist in Bedstuy, Stolen Magnolia in
            Bushwick/Ridgewood, and Sunny's Florist in the East Village.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Think of someone in your life you are really proud of and tell them.</li>
    <li>And <a href="https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/kindness-ideas">many more</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As always, follow your heart.
