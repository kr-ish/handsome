<h1>Offline October</h1>
<div class="bodytext">

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Social media is expertly designed to steal your attention and prey on human addiction.
Almost everything is an ad. If you are so privileged to do so, maybe a month long break
from any and all of it would do good for your soul. Perhaps it would even inspire some
new ideas or actualize some latent ambitions. Though the parameters I've outlined for myself
below are a tad convoluted- yours could be as simple as deleting your most used infinitely
scrolling app. Follow your heart!
</p>

<p>
    All you have to do is pick something and stick to it.
</p>

<h2>Objections</h2>
<div class="conversation">
  <div class="objection">"I don't have a scrolling problem."</div>
  <div class="response">Try it anyway â€” completely block out one form of social media. It's just one month.</div>

  <div class="objection">"I pay an app / device to limit my screen time."</div>
  <div class="response">See above.</div>

  <div class="objection">"Where will I get recipes?"</div>
  <div class="response">Write some down ahead of time! Or pick up a cookbook that's been laying around, or a new one from the bookshop.</div>

  <div class="objection">"But I have a highly curated algorithm!"</div>
  <div class="response">It is my view that God has left you (but you can always find Her again).</div>

  <div class="objection">"You have attention deficit disorder and should be medicated."</div>
  <div class="response">Word</div>
</div>

</ul>

I will continue to
<ul>
    <li>Send my friends and family photos and ask them to send me photos.</li>
    <li>Go to to the movies</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Dazzling images, on a huge silver screen. Sound that I can feel.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Daily music production practice - even just 5 minutes</li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
    If you would like to participate, email me a statement describing what online activity you would
    like to drop for the month of October. If you would like- include something you want to pick up
    (though I also encourage reclaiming your attention and time without the pressue of adding
    something to the mix), and any parameters you'd like to follow. A picture of you would be nice too.
    The only hard requirements are your statement, and letting me know if you would like it added to the
    website- because I would.
</p>
<p>
    At the end of the month, I will check in with each participant and request a reflection.
